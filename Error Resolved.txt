If you are using both python2 and python3 on your Windows machine, you may get an error so Here's how i resolved it:


1. Add (or verify correct path)

C:\Python35;C:\Python35\Scripts;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts 
to environment variable PATH.

3. Now, Go to C:\Python35 to rename python.exe to python3.exe, also to C:\Python27, rename python.exe to python2.exe.

4. Restart your command window.

5. Now, Type "python2 scriptname.py" in command line to switch the version to python2x (recommended for this project).
